# Lesson 22
README.md is writtin in markdown, with different size titles

md means markdown

## git-essentials
has smaller text compared to Lesson 22 in top

what is project about, contributing rules, how to work with it, sort of instruction manual

## Good practice
updating your README.md regularly

# Lesson 23
##Viewing file differences

git diff filename.ext
ls -la

we gonna edit

nano readme.MD

git status shows readme is modified

git diff README.me, we can see the difference in red replaced and green is added

git add README.md then git commit and git push we update this file

git diff is always smart todo before commiting
# Lesson 24
sometimes we want to ignore files

We create a new file .todo

suppose we dont want to add this file

we gonna create .gitignore, and list filename and types that we dont want

now, .todo does not show when we git status
