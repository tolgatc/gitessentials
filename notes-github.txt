---Lesson 4---
git config --global user.name "full name" (configure name)
git config --global user.email "full name" (configure email , match github)

---Lesson 6---

---Lesson 7---
assume you have repo: gitessentials
quick setup follow on github commands
mkdir test (makes directory test)
git init (.git folder creation)
git add README.me (add file README.me to commit)
git status (shows status currently)
git commit -m "First commit"
git log
git remote add origin (add here url of your repo)
git push origin master
---Lesson 10---
unstager work
stage work
commit work
push work

flow for pushing work

creat file nano first-file.txt (create file and enter something)

now you have new file
git status (and see it has been added, untracked)

not staged yet

git add first-file.txt
git status (not it is staged, not push yet)
git commit -m "first push" (this created commited)
git push origin master (this take current commit to origin(github), uploaded an new)


---Lesson 11---
git status (run often!)

edit first-push.txt file
git status will show first-push is modified

now

git add first-push.txt or git add . (all files)

git status show this file to b comited

git commit -m

git status will show nothing, now say
git push origin master (send to github, new commit)

rm first-push.txt (removes file)
ls -la, show  files gona
git status will saym file is deleted 
--- Lesson 12 ---
git add . (add all files)

git status (now will show the files is deleted)

what if we dont want to commit and unstage
git reset HEAD first-push.txt
git status
Now file is unstaged, its not undeleted

git add first-push.txt

git reset HEAD frst-push.txt

git status (shows unstaged)

how to undelete
