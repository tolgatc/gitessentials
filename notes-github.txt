---Lesson 3---
dir (show directory)
cd (change directory)
pwd (working directory
---Lesson 4---
git config --global user.name "full name" (configure name)
git config --global user.email "full name" (configure email , match github)
cat ~/.gitconfig (should show file with data above)
---Lesson 5---
ssh-keygen -o (generate ssh key)

- This key should be pasted into github ssk keys in seetings
---Lesson 6---
git clone (url with ssh in github)
ls -la (shows all files)
git log

---Lesson 7---
assume you have repo: gitessentials
quick setup follow on github commands
mkdir test (makes directory test)
git init (.git folder creation)
git add README.me (add file README.me to commit)
git status (shows status currently)
git commit -m "First commit"
git log
git remote add origin (add here url of your repo)
git push origin master
---Lesson 10---
unstager work
stage work
commit work
push work

flow for pushing work

creat file nano first-file.txt (create file and enter something)

now you have new file
git status (and see it has been added, untracked)

not staged yet

git add first-file.txt
git status (not it is staged, not push yet)
git commit -m "first push" (this created commited)
git push origin master (this take current commit to origin(github), uploaded an new)


---Lesson 11---
git status (run often!)

edit first-push.txt file
git status will show first-push is modified

now

git add first-push.txt or git add . (all files)

git status show this file to b comited

git commit -m

git status will show nothing, now say
git push origin master (send to github, new commit)

rm first-push.txt (removes file)
ls -la, show  files gona
git status will saym file is deleted 
--- Lesson 12 ---
git add . (add all files)

git status (now will show the files is deleted)

what if we dont want to commit and unstage
git reset HEAD first-push.txt
git status
Now file is unstaged, its not undeleted

git add first-push.txt

git reset HEAD frst-push.txt

git status (shows unstaged)

how to undelete

--- Lesston 13 ---
alread did rm first push

its gone

with git:

git checkout -- first-push.txt
git status, will show brach is up to date and file exist again

rm first-push.txt
git checkout first-push.txt
file came back
---lesson 14---
git remote -v, shows all rmote oigin

git push production feature branch name

---lesson 15---

git checkout -b new-branch
git checkout new-branch

still all local

git branch shows we are all now new bracnh

--- lesston 16
git checkout -b new-branch makes new branch

switch between branch is with git checkout -name

create newf ile new-branch file

ls -la shows new file

git add new-branch file
git commit  -m "new branch"

git push origin new-branch

if you do origin master its not corect

now you can see github accep new coe, there is new code with file

doesnta exist in master

---lesston 17--- merging

gt cehckout newbranch

gona merge. first update master before doing something

git checkout master
git pull origin master

git merge new-branch

new file, 

git status

ls-la shows new file

github only did this local

git push origin master send to github

master now on github website has new stuff

and the file showd under master branch

---lesson 18

git log shows latest change

see latest new branch

git pull origin master, gets latest version on git

 j k moving in git log
 
 with q exti
 
 ---leson 19---
 
 git pull origin master, for current branch
 
 no updates
 
 edit readme manually online
 
 add stuff 
 
 git pull origin master bring commit to computer
 
 fast forawrd and changes in file
 
 if you try to push with stuff still top pull gives error
 
 edit new branchf ile
 
 one commit behind
 
 touch empty-file.txt
 
 ls -la shows file in it, git add and commmt
 
 we dont have updaetd branch file


git push origin master rejected
